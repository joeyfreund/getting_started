In the [previous part of this tutorial]({{site.baseurl }}{{page.previous.url}}) we created tweets directly from the console. Why is that? We could have ran the following code in the console.

{% highlight ruby %}
jruby-1.7.18 :021 > xput '/model/tweet', {text: 'Learning about #xnlogic is fun!'}
{% endhighlight %}

The problem is that, this way, we do not relate between a tweet and the user who created it. In fact, in our data model, it doesn't even make sense to create a tweet without a user. In other words, posting a tweet should be an action (i.e. instance method) taken by a user.

## Defining the `post_tweet` action

In xnlogic, defining the `post_tweet` method and exposing it to the API are two separate concepts. 

> _Note:_ A design philosophy of xnlogic is to give you "full access" when writing Ruby code that interacts with your data, but require you to explicitly expose functionality you want to make available via the API.

All code updates will happen in `lib/my_app/parts/user.rb`.

We will start by adding the following code, inside the `User` module.
{% highlight ruby %}
module Vertex
    def post_tweet(t)
        tweet = self.app.create(M::Tweet, {text: t})
        tweet.user = self
        tweet
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The code above defines the `post_tweet` instance method that creates a tweet, and sets its _from-one user_ relation to `self`.    
There are a few things to notice:
 * The method is defined inside a module called `Vertex`.
 * This method changes the graph (by creating an object), and, therefore, will have to be called inside a transaction.
 * This method returns the created tweet to the caller.

> _Note:_ The statement `tweet.user = self` creates the relation between the user and the tweet. Alternatively, we could have define the same relation with the statement `self.add_tweets(tweet)`.

Next, we will expose our `post_tweet` method as as API action, by adding the following code to the `User` module.
{% highlight ruby %}
action :post_tweet, args: [{:t => :text}] do |context, t|
    self.post_tweet(t)
end
{% endhighlight %}

The code above declares an action called `post_tweet` with a single parameter (whose name is `t` and type is `text`). It also defines the action as a Ruby block.

> _Note:_ Actions are automatically wrapped in a transaction.

> _Tip:_ Keep your action definition (i.e. the block) simple. Ideally, it should only contain a call to an instance method. 


At this point, `lib/my_app/parts/user.rb` should contain the following code.

{% highlight ruby %}
module MyApp
  module User
    xn_part

    property :username, type: :text
    property :email, type: :text

    to_many :Tweet

    action :post_tweet, args: [{:t => :text}] do |context, t|
        self.post_tweet(t)
    end

    module Vertex
        def post_tweet(t)
            tweet = self.app.create(M::Tweet, {text: t})
            tweet.user = self
            tweet
        end
    end

  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Performing an action via the API

Actions are performed using POST requests. 
 * We append `action/ACTION_NAME` to the path of the request.
 * We send the arguments as a JSON object (associating parameter names to argument values)

For example, if we want user 73 to post the tweet `'Hello World'`, we make the following request.

{% highlight ruby %}
jruby-1.7.18 :021 > xpost '/model/user/id/73/action/post_tweet', {t: "Hello World"}
 => [{:meta=>{:xnid=>"/model/job_result/id/86", :model_name=>"job_result", :rendered=>["record", "job"], :format=>"partial", :rel_limit=>50}, :id=>86, :name=>nil, :model_name=>"job_result", :description=>nil, :created_at=>2015-02-18 20:46:55 UTC, :status=>:complete, :messages=>nil, :request_url=>nil, :source_url=>"/model/user/id/73", :action_type=>"action", :action_name=>"post_tweet", :action_args=>{"t"=>"Hello World"}, :part_name=>"user", :value=>nil, :display_name=>"post_tweet"}]
{% endhighlight %}

We can verify that we can see our new tweet in the user's tweets.
{% highlight ruby %}
jruby-1.7.18 :022 > xget '/model/user/id/73/rel/tweets/properties/text'
[85, "Hello World"] [82, "Learning #xnlogic is fun"]  [81, "No more snow! #wintersucks"]
{% endhighlight %}

We can also verify that we can access the user from the tweet.
{% highlight ruby %}
jruby-1.7.18 :023 > xget '/model/tweet/id/85/rel/user/properties/username'
[73, "cynthia"]
{% endhighlight %}
